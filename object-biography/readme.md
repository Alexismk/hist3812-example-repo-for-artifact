### The Artist: Andy Warhol 

Andy Warhol was an American artist active in the mid to late twentieth century. Warhol is considered by many to be a renaissance man, as he was also a film maker, a TV producer, a writer, a photographer, a designer a model, and more. (Wollen, 1995) Despite his many talents, Warhol was best known for his abstract works of art which has since revolutionized how art is made, perceived, and interpreted.

Warhol was born in Pittsburgh to Slovakian immigrant parents. As a young child. He grew up in the working class district of the city and had always had a talent for art. Warhol gradated Carnegie Tech in Pittsburgh in 1949 with a degree in fine arts. He would go on to train as an art designer and later as an advertising illustrator and commercial artist for magazines and newspapers in New York City (National Gallery of Canada, 2018).

Warhol’s time in New York would come to change his perspective of art and commercial society, paving the way for his revolutionary artistic approach. Warhol was inspired by popular culture and commercial products, materialism, Hollywood, and fashion, and would appropriate these subjects into his own works of art (National Gallery of Canada, 2018).

In the 1960s, Andy Warhol would come to be the leading figure in the development of a subgenre of art known as “pop art”. His art would often blur the distinction between art and contemporary society, creating artworks based on the world he lived in (National Gallery of Canada, 2018). His early works consisted of hand painted artworks that were loosely influenced by the Abstract Expressionism, however in later years, his style would developed and become a direct rejection of both high art and Abstract Expressionism (The Art Story Contributors, 2018). His work became a mockery of fine art, as he tuned banal, everyday objects and presented them as art. He removed the artist hand from the creative processes, instead opting to use mechanical, mass production techniques, mimicking and mocking mass material consumption. (National Gallery of Canada, 2018)

Some of Andy Warhol’s most famous works were screen printed designs that replicated the packaging of house hold items (such as Campbell’s Soup Cans and Brillo Soap Pad Boxes). Warhol changed the way in which art was produced, and the medium and materials that were used in art. He produced most of his art in his studio “factory” with the help of hired hand (National Gallery of Canada, 2018). Many of his images were not physically produced by him, rather they are his ideas. The images were taken from magazines and public photos and appropriated by him. He was fond of using forms of repetition to display that repetitive banality of the media and consumer society. 

The works of Andy Warhol have been greatly contested during his time, and still remain a subject of debate even to this day. His works appear to be a critique of social culture and high culture, and yet, he was a very much a participant within that social class. Many argue that his appropriation of commercial designs and photographs overstepped legal and ethical boundaries of copyright laws (Golec, 2008).

Warhol was purposely ambiguous about the meanings of his works and his reasons beyond them, only going as far as to deny any link to socio-political commentary (National Gallery of Canada, 2018). Nevertheless, his images have become iconic representations of American pop art and a mass consumerism society.


## Andy Warhol, Brillo Soap Pads Boxes, 1964

Brillo Soap Pad Boxes is a sculpture by Andy Warhol and is made out of numerous wooden, screen printed boxes. The sculpture was made in 1964, during the height of Warhol’s career, and was purchased by the National Gallery of Canada in 1967, where it now resides as a permanent display in the gallery’s Contemporary Art exhibit. 

Andy Warhol has been quite the source of controversy at the National Gallery of Canada specifically. In 1965 an exhibition of Warhol’s Campbell's Soup Cans and Brillo Soap Pad Boxes was cancelled after the gallery director Charles Comfort would not acknowledge his works as art rather than commercial products, and they could not make it through Canada’s Customs duty free (Simpson, 2010). This would be two years before the gallery would purchase eight Brillo Soap Pad Boxes of their own. 

Like much of Andy Warhol’s pop art, Brillo Soap Pad Boxes appropriates and replicates the design of household commercial packaging, removing it from its context and is redisplaying it in a gallery as a work of art. This work forces the viewer to question the boundaries between art and everyday items, and reflect upon the significance of these objects in our commercialized consumer society.
