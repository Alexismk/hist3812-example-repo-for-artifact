# Object Biography

In this readme file, you explain the context and background for your object. Think of this as being rather like a wikipedia page giving the basic particulars of the object/site/building/whatever that you have modeled. It should be complete enough that I understand why your object matters, and could find more information if I want.

Use Harvard author-date system for citations, as that works better with plain text than trying to figure out footnotes (footnotes are a hangover from an industrial model of text preparation).
