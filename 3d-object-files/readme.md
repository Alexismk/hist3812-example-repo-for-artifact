# Object Files

In this folder please put the .obj, .mtl, and .png files that are created by the photogrammetry process.

It might be that Github tells you that the file is too big. In that case, modify this readme file to tell me where I might find (and be able to download) your model. In most cases, this will be [sketchfab.com](http://sketchfab.com). Here is a [quickstart guide to sketchfab](https://help.sketchfab.com/hc/en-us/articles/203994889-Quick-Start-Guide).
