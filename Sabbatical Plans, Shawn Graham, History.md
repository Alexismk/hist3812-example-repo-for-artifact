Sabbatical Plans, Shawn Graham, History

- I have applied for, and won, with my colleague Tom Brughmans of the University of Konstanz an Ontario Baden-Wuertemberg award to bring Brughmans to Carleton in the Fall of 2016. Together, we will be exploring simulation and gaming as a vector for research on the ancient Roman economy. We intend to hold a workshop on computational methods for archaeology and history during this period.

- I also intend to spend time reading, researching, and developing a series of grant proposals to SSHRC, the AHRC, and the NEH that will follow on from our collaboration

- My travel plans involve short trips to centres of excellence in digital history and digital archaeology. While nothing is currently 100% arranged, I have invitations to visit the Alexandria Archive in Berkeley, California (who run the Open Context project, http://opencontext.org project), York University's Centre for Digital Heritage in the UK (http://york.ac.uk/digital-heritage), and Scholar's Lab at the University of Virginia (http://scholarslab.org/). I will be able to fund these trips out of my existing PER and through various small travel grants I intend to apply for.

- These visits are part of the preparation for a book project on the digital representation of Roman archaeology for a new series from Ashgate Press, 'Studies in Roman Space and Urbanism' (https://www.ashgate.com/default.aspx?page=5097&series_id=1218862607&calcTitle=1), which is my next project after the successful completion of my digital history textbook, 'The Macroscope' (http://themacroscope)

- I will be in the Ottawa area for most of the sabbatical, though while away I will be in regular Skype contact with my Master's and Phd students.

- I intend to attend the major disciplinary conferences in digital humanities and in archaeology during the sabbatical, as well as some lesser meetings in eastern Canada. 'DH2017' will be in Montreal, while the Society for American Archaeology meeting will be in Vancouver. At DH2017 I intend to present work I am currently doing on the intersection of sound art and the sonification of humanities data. With Brughmans at the SAA, we will be organizing some sessions and workshops at the on computational archaeology. In 2015 I hosted a virtual conference on 'archaeogaming', or the intersection of video games and the representation of archaeology, via Google's 'hangout' technology that attracted 30 participants from around the world. I will be doing this again.
