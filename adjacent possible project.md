The strange and beautiful truth about the adjacent possible is that its boundaries grow as you explore them.


# Sabbatical Project 2016-17: The Adjacent Possible

During my first sabbatical, I am pursuing a program of research to explore the 'adjacent possible' of writing and researching about the past. The adjacent possible is a term that emerges out of complexity theory and biology, to describe the idea that within a given complex of relationships, there are a limited number of states to which the system may evolve. The popular author Steven Johnson describes the idea as "[...]a kind of shadow future, hovering on the edges of the present state of things, a map of all the ways in which the present can reinvent itself." ('The Genius of the Tinkerer', Wall Street Journal, Sept 25 2010). I wish to explore this map for history and archaeology.

As a first step, I have applied for, and won, with my colleague Tom Brughmans of the University of Konstanz an Ontario Baden-Wuertemberg award to bring Brughmans to Carleton in the Fall of 2016. Together, we will be exploring simulation and gaming as a vector for research on the ancient Roman economy. The computational power of video games to represent processes in the past allow us to bridge the middle range between the material culture and literary history of antiquity. It thus represents an 'adjacent possible' for doing research. We anticipate running a series of workshops and 'unconferences' to bring together similar-minded researchers to Carleton. We are in the process of applying for funding to support these.

Concommitant with this computational research, we have to think about how one can, or could, or indeed should, publish such research. Publishing in a print or static journal medium undermines the nature of the rhetorical argument when the past is represented in computational processes. The historian William Urrichio argued in 2005 that computational processes of video games (and by extension, digital media more generally) are analogous to historiography. The literary theorist Ian Bogost (2007) calls these 'procedural rhetorics'. The second part of the Adjacent Possible Project is therefore to explore a way of publishing what might be called the 'paradata' (London Charter of Heritage Visualization, 2012) of digital research.

With the support of MacOdrum's Open Access initiatives, I will be exploring this issue by creating a new open access journal project with Greg Fisher of Greek and Roman Studies at Carleton for  journal that would support and explore digital work in history and archaeology. I am provisionally calling it ‘Paradata’, with the idea that the journal would be an open peer-reviewed venue for the supporting scholarship that goes towards digital projects, rather than the digital projects themselves. (This work also builds on our open writing experiment successfully concluded in my born-digital electronic and physical book 'The Macroscope'). There is currently no such journal in existence, and as things like SSHRC require more of one’s research process to be made available, I feel this would fill a real need.)

I foresee travel to centres of excellence in digital history, heritage, and archaeology-

- The Department of Archaeology, at York University in the UK, to collaborate with Sara Perry and Colleen Morgan of the interactive heritage visualization MA

- The University of Aarhuss, Denmark, which hosts a cluster of researchers involved in novel experiments in procedural representation and investigation of the past

- Roy Rosenzweig Centre for History and New Media at George Mason University

The costs for visiting these centres will be covered from my existing funds and will not be above the normal expected allowances.
