### The reason I'm painting this way is that I want to be a machine, and I feel that whatever I do and do machine-like is what I want to do.

'What is Pop Art? Answers from 8 Painters', Part 1, G. R. Swenson, in Art News 62, November 1963



As I mentioned in my Process Notes, I deliberately chose Andy Warhol’s “Brillo Soap Pad Boxes” for the topic of my assignment for multiple reasons, the main one being that the nature of the sculpture, and the controversy that surrounds both it and Andy Warhol’s work in general offers many point of debate and reflection.


Andy Warhol’s “Brillo Soap Pad Boxes” is a pop art sculpture that is a recreation of BRILLO’s original soap pad packaging. The intention of the art work, like many of Warhol’s works, was to force the viewer to contemplate the relationship between art and everyday commercial objects. By replicating commercial packaging and presenting it as an artwork, the viewers and the curators are also forced to contemplate their own definition of what constitutes art. 


Andy Warhol’s reproductions as art has garnered much criticism over the decades, but the argument always comes down to the fact that his art is valued for his ideas and the statements that he tries to make about consumer and popular culture in the 1960s. Warhol purposefully created his art in a way that removed the artists hand as much as possible, replicating the ways machines produce consumer product. He used machines such a screen printers to print photographs, and would hire out people to work in his “Factory” to produce many of the works for him (Golec, 2008). His art is considered by some to be as unartistic and uncreative as it gets, and yet he is one of the most celebrates American Artists in modern times. 

Mhairi Maxwell profoundly notes in his paper Power is in the Process: The ACCORD project that “In the end we value human creativity above machines” (Maxwell, 2107). To me, this is why Andy Warhol’s work is regarded so highly. While he uses machines, helping hands, and pre-existing designs and images, it is the way that he re-purposes these images and objects that is what makes his work creative, and thus, art. The technology at his disposal allows Warhol to “seek to introduce the value of human creativity” (Maxwell, 2107) into otherwise, banal household objects. In addition, as Maxell notes, “despite his attempts to hide behind the machine, we are always aware of the personality who created the work” (Maxwell, 2107), and it is that creative personality that gives life and meaning to the artwork.


I think the framework of ideas can also be applied to work we have been doing with 3D modeling. We are more removed from the subject and we use technology to create a copy of the artifact at hand. Simply copying an object and processing it through a program to create a 3D model seems uncreative, and the final result would not be classified as art by many. But in essence, we are doing exactly as Warhol did; we are reproducing and repurposing and object for own use, and giving it a new meaning. While Warhol wished for his audience to contemplate his work and their own culture, our 3D models function as an informative tool that allows others to discover the artifact virtually. Furthermore, there is much more involvement in the creation process on our part. Personally, I had to edit photos and fiddle with the program to get the best result, and it required a substantial amount of trial and error. If the process was completely devoid of human creativity, the program would do a perfect job generating a 3D model the first time. 

While making a 3D model of Warhol’s “Brillo Soap Pad Boxes”, I also had to remove the background of the images and subsequently, the context of the sculpture, that is, the gallery and the setting. In doing so I changed the meaning and the intent that the artist originally had for his work. While a viewer can look at my model and see a 3D image of the sculpture, it may not cause them to understand the meaning behind the sculpture, or contemplate why a consumer product would be displayed in the gallery. 





I would like to now take an opportunity to examine Warhol’s Brillo Soap Boxes (and BRILLO boxes as a whole) in the context of Paul Reilly’s ‘persistency versus permeability’ grid framework, which allows the journey of an object and its various forms to be detailed and understood. 


Andy Warhol’s “Brillo Soap Pad Boxes” is special because it is already a fac simile before I began creating my own fac simile by modeling it in 3D. Warhol’s sculpture was modelled after BRILLO’s original soap pad boxes and the packaging that was designed by James Harvey in 1961 (Golec, 2008). This is where the Brillo box journey truly begins. 


Before being an artwork and a social critique, the Brillo box was a simple shipping carton for scrubbing pads. The boxes themselves can be considered “momentary”, as they are used for transport, and the cardboard is eventually thrown out once the product has been received. The BRILLO brand has been around since the beginning on the twentieth century, and was certainly not a new product by the time the 1960s rolled around.  James Harvey was a graphic designer and Abstract Expressionist painter and had been hired in 1961 to redesign the Brillo packaging. He opted for a new, curving text and eye catching fonts. The style was certainly a new approach to packaging in comparison to the straight aligned fonts of the 40s and 50s. Most striking about the package, however, was the colouring. Harvey used a red and blue colouring that contrasted with the white background, and was meant to evoke patriotism as it was the colors of the American flag, and it was representing an American company. 


The representational artwork of the BRILLO boxes made it the perfect subject for Warhol’s anti-consumerism/ anti- American culture artistic statement. He then reproduced the BRILLO packaging imagery onto his own wooden boxes. While he was aiming to create an indistinguishable copy, Warhol’s Brillo Boxes are much more permanent than the actual packaging, as it was intended to last longer. While in the case of the BRILLO packaging, where the boxes served as a practical way to transport the goods it carried, Warhol’s boxes were “the goods” themselves, and were the focal point of his display. 


While trying to copy the packaging of the Brillo soap pads, Warhol also re-appropriated the meaning of the Brillo boxes themselves and changed its “aura”- that is, its essential meaning (Bruno Latour and Adam Lowe, 2010). While the boxes started out as packaging designed to promote their product as well as the company’s long history in America, they were seen as something completely different, and more sinister, when viewed in the context of the art gallery. Warhol effectively erased decades of the company’s all American history, and the Brillo Soap Boxes became known throughout the public under a different light. 


Finally, the final step that the Brillo Soap Pad Boxes have undergone was its recreation as 3D image, making a fac simile out of a fac simile.  When made and viewed as a 3D model, part of the history is lost once again, as the viewer cannot appreciate the context in which his sculpture was meant to be seen in (in a gallery, as mentioned previously). Its meaning becomes an appropriation once again, and the 3D model can only be fully used as a visual supplement, and certainly does not compare to the real thing. Part of the fascination that comes with any artwork or artefact is that that art is has witnessed history, or is representation of the artist himself. Without having that authentic connection and without being able to see the original artefact, part of its meaning, quality, and value is lost. 


Also affecting the victors experience is the fact that BRILLO is not a household name this day and age, and its recognisability is not as apparent as it would have been during the time. Therefore I think its meaning, or at least the effectiveness of Warhol’s message has changed over time. Now we may look at the work as a piece of history and situate it within its own context in the 1960s, rather than look at it as modern art. 

Despite the limitations that 3D modeling processes, I think the fact that this option is available is incredible. While I don’t know how effective it is at conveying art, specifically Andy Warhol’s sculpture, I think the possibilities that offers for other artefacts is revolutionary.  The potential quality of some 3D images can allow people to discover artefacts remotely AND manipulate them without having the touch and potentially damage the invaluable artefact. I am eager to see the potential benefits that technology can offer the field of history and archeology in the future.
